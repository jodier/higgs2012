TElectronEfficiencyCorrection - class to retrieve the electron scale factors in pure ROOT

This Tool replaces the old egammaSFClass from egammaAnalysisUtils. Instead of hard-coded number this tool uses 2d-histograms with an easy naming-scheme. The main difference in the use is that for different scale factors (i.e. different ID-levels) different tools need to be instantiated in the tool. The most-recent scale factors from egammaAnalysisUtils have been converted into the needed format and can be found in the data-subdirectory of this tool. You can find a table with the rel/set obinations used to obtain these histograms at: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasProtected/TElectronEfficiencyCorrectionTool . If you need a scale factor that is not yet converted please let me know and I'll provide it as soon as possible.

There are 3 main functions in the tool:
  
  - addFileName(string)
      add a file containing the scale factors to the tool. In most cases only one file should be added per tool.
  - initialize()
      Need to be called after the tool has been initialized. Internally this reads the needed histograms from the added files.
  - calculate(const PATCore::ParticleDataType::DataType dataType, const unsigned int runnumber, const double cluster_eta, const double et)
      This is the function that returns the needed scale factor for a given combination of run number / eta and et(in MeV) and need to be called in the electron loop of your code. The calculate function returns a TResult (from package PATCore). The scale factor and its uncertainty can then be obtained by calling getScaleFactor() or getTotalUncertainty on the TResult (for more information see the header file TResult.h in the PATCore package)
